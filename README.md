# MailChecker
A open-source MaillAcess checker | You must use good proxies.

## FAQ

Q: Why does my checker automatically closes ?\
A: You must have "alts.txt" and "proxies.txt" in same location as the checker. If it keeps closing, it means you need to write something in them.

Q: What proxies do you support?\
A: We support "HTTP(s)/Socks4/Socks4A/Socks5

Q: My antivirus is flagging.\
A: You must disable your antivirus to make the checker work. If you don't trust me, then build the project on your pc and use it.

Q: Your code is bad.\
A: I know, I made it in a few hours, so feel free to open a pull-request to update it.

Q: Where can I get  good proxies ?.\
A: I don't know. I just code.

## Requirements

You must have .NET Framework 4.7.2 and that's all
